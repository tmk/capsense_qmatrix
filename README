Capacitive Sense - DIY Realforce 106s controller
================================================
This scans capacitive switch matrix using Atmel QMatrix method.



Realforce 106s Matrix
=====================

My controller scans matrix with 16 drive lines and 8 sense lines.
Sense lines are multiplexed by ADC MUX of AT90USB1286.

Meanwhile original Topre controller scans with 8 drive lines and 16 sense lines.
Sense lines are multiplexed by two 74HC4051 analog multiplexers.

Where Rxx means marking of resiter on PCB.



Memo
====
- Other drive lines than bursted one should be grounded to remove influence of capacitances not under test.
- Drive lines with resistor in series avoid divergence of sensing values. R=1KOhm
- Measured value of sense lines(Y) are electromagnetically infuenced depending on physical distance from drive lines(X)
    I had to place sensing compoenets(Csample and Rs) apart from drive lines(PC0-7) to remove EMS influence.
- Vaule changes
    - at startup: calculate threshold value of each node
        Boot magic - keys can be holded while keyboard is starting up
            - how holded keys are determined?
                - use average of all nodes as threashold
                - use last threashold valued stored in eeprom
                - error when many keys are stacked
    - long time change: >10s? tune threshold values (runtime recalibration)
    - short time change: recognized as human operation
    - key press - change in short time
        - threashold
            average(from long time data except for values while pressed)
        - hysteresis - threshold is changed when key is pressed
    - cross-talk on both adjacent X and Y line
        - cross-talk between adjacent X lines
            - removed by pulling other X lines down to *LOW* while the burst
            - HIZ causes cross-talk severely between adjacent X lines
        - cross-talk between adjacent Y lines
            - reduced much by sensing one of even/odd Y line group(0,2,4,6/1,3,5,7) at a time
            - both Ya and Yb are LOW when other line is measured
- Slow Scan
    - burst: 64 cycles, 6us per cycle = 380us/line (3us/200us with inline optimisation)
    - 16ms for 16X*8Y, 2 burst/sense cycles per line 09/21
    - if keys are pressed sense time becomes longer hence scan takes longer
    - how improve: fast burst pulse, short burst length, small Rsmp

QTouchADC
    QTouchADC only requires 1-series resistor and 1-pin per channel. No other external components are required.
    QTouchADC offers faster acquisition times with shorter burst lengths, resulting in lower power consumption.

Voltage of Cs
    http://forum.atmel.com/showthread.php?t=2023
    The terminal voltage that appears across the Cs capacitor has to be in the range of -50mV to -150mV. The terminal voltage should not exceed -250mV due to diode i/o conduction.
